1. Description
==============
notifmail is an email daemon checker which uses libnotify to pull for new email
from IMAP servers. It is written in python. Easy to configure and use.


2. Installation
===============

2.A. Prerequsites
-----------------
Have python and needed libraries on host:
- python
- libnotify2 for python
- openssl
- python-daemon
Example - Fedora:
$ sudo yum install python notify-python openssl python-daemon

2.B. Install
------------
$ cd <notifmail git clone directory>
$ sudo ./setup.py install


3. Configuration
================
notifmail uses a configuration for connection to IMAP server and for other
configurations. A sample file one is packaged in the sources as
"notifmail.conf.sample". To get started copy this file in ~/.notifmail:
$ mkdir ~/.notifmail
$ cp ./notifmail.conf.sample ~/.notifmail/notifmail.conf
Edit ~/.notifmail/notifmail.conf.sample with your configuration.


4. Running notifmail
====================
$ notifmail


5. notifmail 'home' directory
==========================
notifmail's 'home' directory is located in $HOME/.notifmail and contains:

5.A. notifmail.conf
-------------------
This file contains the IMAP accounts configuration to be used by notifmail.
Can contain multiple accounts but each account must include:
- imap_server
- imap_user
- imap_password
There are two optional variables:
- all: Used to define mailboxes for which notifmail should trigger a
notification with every new email. Multiple mailboxes must be separated by
semicolon.
- summary: Used to define mailboxes for which notifmail should trigger one
summary notification. Multiple mailboxes must be separated by semicolon.
See 3. Configuration also.

5.B. notifmail.log
==================
This is the logging file. By default notifmail runs as daemon so all messages go
to this file. If you run daemon in foreground, log messages will be duplicated
between logfile and stdout. For more info run:
$ notifmail -h

5.C. notifmail.lock
===================
This is a lock file to avoid having multiple notifmail instances.
